MorioKart : Konnan, Inti, HankHill
Final Project

Description: Drive the kart around the map. Drive as fast as you can
Lights: There is an unseen light in the middle of the map and the start light also affects the kart. When using the easter egg, the car is effected by another yellow light that follows you.(The starting light is our active one, super sain light is also active)
    materials are used on the kart as well as a texture.
Animation: The penguin flags and waddles and shakes his head.
Textures: Lots of textures, more than 2
Shaders:
    Lots of shader stuff.
    Light up when you use easter egg, go small when you go the wrong way too much
    See shaders for more, multipass rendering is used for the map (worked on ink, might not be done by the time we turn this in :) )

There is an easter egg

Usage:

Compiling: make -B && fp.exe
